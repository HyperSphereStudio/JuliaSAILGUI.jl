# JULIASAILGUI

Graphic Interface Library in Julia I designed while being a research assistant at Embry-Riddle's Space Atmospheric Instrumentation Laboratory.

The goal of this library to control embedded systems (custom communication protocols), display data, and data analysis.

It contains a vast amount of other libraries that are compiled into a native image in order to have fast deployed execution.
